This is one of my first big projects and it was my high school final project. Being one of my first projects the code is not very organized and the application is not very well structured.

It consists of a school application for students and teachers where they can see their grades (students) or post grades for students (teachers).

To test this app you have to put it on a web server and run the sql script "final.sql". A user for testing is admin1@gmail.com and the password is 123456.

For more information go to "notesite_documentacion.pdf".
